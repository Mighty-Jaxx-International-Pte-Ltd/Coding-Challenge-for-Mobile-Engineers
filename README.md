# Coding Challenge for Mobile Engineers

## Requirements

- React Native
- Redux 

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo and create your own GitHub repository.
2. Push your git repo to GitHub.
3. Initialize a new React Native project
4. Fetch a list of photos from Unsplash Photo API (https://unsplash.com/documentation#list-photos) that shows the photo information as an infinite feed. Each photo should have:
  - A main image
  - The title and description
  - The number of likes that each photo has received. There is no need to display comments for the purpose of this assignment
  - The feed should be infinite scrolling, not paginated. If the user is about to reach the end of the feed, the app should load the next photos
  - The app should refresh the feed if the user pulls down on the app at the top of the feed (similar to usual feed refresh behavior)
  - The app should be reasonably pleasing in terms of User Interface. Feel free to interpret the design however you prefer
5. When you are done, send us the link to your GitHub repo.

## Bonus
